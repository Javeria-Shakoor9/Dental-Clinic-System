                    <p>Smile Makeover Treatment combines procedures like whitening the discoloured teeth, placing veneers for hiding imperfections, and aligning the teeth with braces to enhance the smile. For achieving Teeth Makeover perfection, we recommend veneers for the teeth that are visible when smiling. Normally, these are 8 to 10 bottom and top teeth at the front. Mostly, people have an idea of what they do not like in their smile – whether it is missing teeth, discolouration, old crowns, or crooked teeth. With our Best Smile Makeover Dentist fixing the smile, it will look flawless in the end.</p>

                    <p>Direct veneers, also known as Composite Veneers, are made with a tooth-coloured filling material. They are used to improve the appearance of discoloured and damaged teeth that are misaligned or have unattractive gaps between them. Placing these veneers does not require drilling or injections and instantly transforms smiles. In substance, they are a layer of a resin material that is applied to the teeth directly. Sometimes called instant or Resin Veneers, they can be placed in just one visit – leaving the patient with a gorgeous smile in just a few hours.</p>
