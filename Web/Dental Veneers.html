                <div>
                    <p>Traditionally, the common solution to straighten crooked teeth is with braces. However, they take many months and sometimes even years to align teeth. Once they are applied, many people tend to feel critical and self-conscious of their appearance. Thankfully, veneers are a suitable alternative that will have you flaunt your smile wherever you go. We provide this alternative treatment that can be completed without you having to wear braces. This means that even your uneven and crooked smile can be transformed in a short time and without the traditional discomfort of braces.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>If you have an uneven or low gum line, the condition is described as a gummy smile. With gum sculpting, even the gummiest of smiles can be transformed to create a perfect smile and restore the natural proportions of teeth. To procedures are used for achieving the results â€“ surgical lifting of gums in severe cases or soft tissue gum sculpting for subtle improvements. The sculpting is usually done in conjunction with veneers for enhancing the appearance. In cases that require just taking away a millimeter of gum, the procedure takes a few hours only. However, for a surgical lift, the healing time is much longer.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Teeth can get discoloured because of many reasons. If you drink tea and coffee regularly or if you are a smoker, minor teeth discolouration can occur. Even though it can be fixed with a teeth whitening treatment temporarily, the long-term fix is getting veneers. The highly-skilled dentists at JR Dental Clinic can provide you with veneers that give a whiter and brighter smile. You might only require one tooth replaced with a veneer or a full-set replacement with veneers. After a consultation, we will advise you on the best treatment option that delivers a perfect smile.</p>

                    <p>Veneers are used for correcting broken, chipped, and severely worn down teeth easily and quickly. Tooth wear can cause chips here and there or their biting edges that wear off because of grinding over time. People with severely worn down teeth cannot undergo a whitening treatment but can get them restored with veneers at JR Dental Clinic From the length of the teeth to their natural curve, veneers can fix everything. They are ultra-fine porcelain facings applied on the front surface of the teeth and hide the underlying cosmetic concerns.</p>

                <h1>Missing Teeth</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Commonly, an upper sideways incisor is missing in adults. Such a condition leads to gaps between teeth and wrongly positioned canine teeth that are more visible. If the gaps are small, they can be closed to camouflage the canine teeth and give a balanced smile. In case the gaps are too large, we use dental implants or bridges to replace the missing tooth. Many dental treatment options for replacing missing teeth are offered at JR Dental Clinic. To know if veneers can be used for replacing your missing teeth, visit our dental clinic and get a consultation.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>A narrow smile is often described as a smile that only shows the front 4 to 6 teeth when smiling. It is one of the reasons why people do not flash their smiles as often as they should. Unaligned teeth or uneven shape of the mouth because of missing teeth can cause a narrow smile. Thankfully, it can be corrected with veneers that are placed for widening and enhancing a smile to give it a fuller appearance. The premium cosmetic dental treatments we provide at JR Dental Clinic majorly involve placing veneers for restoring smiles.</p>
