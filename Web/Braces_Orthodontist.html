                <div>
                    <p>Fixed braces are an orthodontic treatment that corrects misaligned teeth for giving a pleasant smile. We offer patients with fixed braces options at JR Dental Clinic for improving their smile by fixing crowded teeth, spaces between teeth, overbites, and underbites. In some cases, we also carry out an orthognathic surgery to surgically correct the jaw after aligning it with fixed braces. Moreover, the cost of fixed braces depends on the extent of the problem existing in the teeth alignment. But do not worry, as we have a team of orthodontists who ensure that the orthodontic treatment delivers the best possible results.</p>

                    <p>Veneers are not an option for people with broken or heavily filled teeth. However, this does not mean that the dentists at JR Dental Clinic cannot help you achieve your dream smile. We can reconstruct and rebuild your smile with porcelain dental crowns that will make the teeth stronger than ever. They are often used for replacing a missing tooth too. As the crowns and bridges encapsulate the complete tooth and repair every cosmetic issue, the smile they create is long-lasting and beautiful. We use the same porcelain to place crowns and bridges as we do for veneers, so a perfect smile is guaranteed.</p>

                    <p>Are you unhappy that you have fluorosis? It is a common dental condition affecting many people and leads to patchy and mottled discoloured spots on the teeth. Even though many cases are mild, fluorosis can often get severe – having a considerable impact on the appearance of teeth and ruining a sparkly smile. Unfortunately, teeth whitening treatments can worsen the condition by highlighting the contrasted discoloured spots on the teeth. If you are suffering from fluorosis, take charge of the situation and invest in getting veneers. They cover the surface of the teeth and hide the appearance of spots.</p>
