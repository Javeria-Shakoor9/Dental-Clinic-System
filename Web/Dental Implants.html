                <div>
                    <p>Bone grafting has many practical dental applications when it is applied with periodontal procedures – especially dental implants. Many patients often do not understand how this highly-common process benefits. It is needed for increasing the amount of bone in a specific part of the jaw where additional support is needed for the tooth structure or the bone material has deteriorated. Compared to other treatment procedures, it is relatively minor. Only an incision is made to expose the jawbone and graft new bone material into it. The body then creates new bone cells around the grafted area and builds up the jawbone.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Full mouth reconstruction is also known as full mouth restoration or rehabilitation. It is a treatment procedure that involves cosmetic and general dental procedures.

After undergoing a full-mouth reconstruction at JR Dental Clinic, patients get free of every dental problem, have a complete set of functioning teeth, and an improved smile.

                <div>
                    <p>Missing teeth look odd, and restoring them gives the desired smile makeover. In the past, patients had two options only for that – dentures and dental bridges. Now, they can choose between more effective dental implant options, including implant-supported crowns and bridges. They are supported by implants that are inserted into the jawbone to replace the missing teeth. In appearance, the implants look similar to screws and are covered with a dental crown. Patients that require several teeth replacements are good candidates for implant-supported crowns and bridges. Also, because the implants look completely natural, they are not noticeable.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Many people are self-conscious about their teeth and seek solutions to make themselves more positive and confident about their smiles. Some common reasons behind that are teeth being chipped, crooked, uneven, having gaps between them, protruding, or discolouration. If you want to flaunt a gorgeous smile whenever greeting someone without being conscious about how your teeth look, veneers are the answer. The dentists at JR Dental Clinic can help you with this so that you are confident in your smile once again.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Direct veneers also known as composite veneers are made with a tooth-coloured filling material. They are used for improving the appearance of discoloured or damaged teeth with improper alignment or unattractive gaps between them. These veneers do not require any kind of drilling in teeth or injections for transforming a smile instantly. In essence, a composite veneer is a layer of resin material applied to the teeth directly. Sometimes, these veneers are also called instant veneers because they can be placed in just one visit – leaving the patient with a beautiful smile in a matter of hours.</p>
