                <div>
                    <p>Fillings are used for treating caries and cavities that are holes in the teeth. If not treated early, teeth with cavities cause many complications like infections and even tooth loss because they are prone to bacteria buildup. Unfortunately, cavities show no symptoms and go unnoticed until they grow too large. General dentists at Dental Aesthetics spot the signs of cavities early and treat them before they turn into a severe problem. In most cases, they treat and restore the cavity the same day with fillings right after discovering it. Overall, getting fillings is a painless procedure that only takes a single appointment – and the patient is good to leave the clinic with cavity-free teeth.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Do you have a tooth that is damaged extensively or is at a high risk of fracture? A traditional filling might not be enough to support it for long. In these cases, doctors suggests patients to get dental crowns for restoring their affected teeth. While a filling fills the hole in the damaged tooth, it is covered with a crown to prevent further damage and decay. We also use crowns regularly for treating chipped teeth and restoring a tooth after root canal treatment. In cases where crowns are the treatment option, we first prepare the teeth for placing crowns and then proceed further.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Indirect fillings are also known as inlays and onlays that are made at a dental laboratory. They are a cosmetic dentistry procedure used when the tooth structure is insufficient for supporting a filling or has moderate to mild decay. Provided that the tooth cusp is not damaged, inlays are placed on the tooth surface directly. However, if a more significant portion of the teeth or cups is damaged, we use onlays for covering the entire surface of a tooth. Normally, inlays and onlays are made using ceramic material or a composite of porcelain in a dental laboratory. When attached to the teeth using an adhesive dental cement, they strengthen the teeth, restore their shape and help avoid further decay.</p>

                    <p>Patients generally perceive that a root canal treatment is a painful procedure with a questionable prognosis and result. However, for the patients that have to undergo a root canal, our doctors has some good news. Using minimally invasive techniques, his team of endodontists at Dental Aesthetics can take you out of pain. They ease the pain by removing the affected nerve tissue and the pulp. After that, the endodontists fill the canals and seal the root/tooth to prevent further problems.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Tooth infection, excessive tooth decay, and crowding can require tooth extraction. When a tooth has to be removed completely from the mouth, the general dentists at Dental Aesthetics carry out the extraction procedure in a painless way. Even though it is a quite common procedure, we only extract a tooth when necessary because having a missing tooth looks embarrassing. Once we extract a tooth for a patient, it is also replaced with dental prostheses such as bridges, crowns, or an implant. Therefore, ensuring that the tooth extraction does not affect the patient’s smile and self-confidence.</p>

                    <p>Dentures are removable replacements for missing teeth and their surrounding tissues. We provide two types of dentures at Dental Aesthetics – partial and complete. Partial dentures are used when only a few teeth are missing and natural ones remain. They take support from the surrounding teeth and are placed using metal clasps. Patients can remove these types of dentures themselves at night or when cleaning teeth. In comparison, complete dentures are used when all the teeth are missing. Often called false teeth, they are removable as well. So, if all of your lower or upper teeth are completely missing, full dentures are your treatment option.</p>
