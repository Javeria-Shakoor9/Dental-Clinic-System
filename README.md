# Dental-Clinic-System
In the Dental Clinic System project, I developed a web app using HTML, CSS, and Java Servlets for patient registration, appointments, and treatment tracking. Using MySQL, I designed the database to manage records efficiently. The system, built with JDK and deployed on Tomcat using Netbeans.

The Dental Clinic System project serves as a foundational web application designed to demonstrate essential functionalities for managing a dental clinic's operations. While it incorporates basic features such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, and treatment history viewing, it is not a fully-fledged application. Instead, this project focuses on the core aspects of a dental management system, providing a glimpse into the potential for further development and enhancement. By utilizing HTML, CSS, Java Servlets, and MySQL, the project highlights the fundamental concepts of frontend design and database management without delving into complex functionalities.

In the Dental Clinic System project, my primary focus was on developing the frontend and designing the database. I used HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and responsive user interface, allowing patients to register, schedule appointments, and view their treatment history easily. I ensured that the frontend was user-friendly, with a clean layout that guided users through the clinic's services, appointment booking, and billing processes seamlessly.

On the database side, I leveraged MySQL to design and structure the database for efficient management of patient records, appointment details, treatment plans, and billing information. I crafted the schema to handle data relationships and ensure quick retrieval of information, improving system performance and reliability.

Using Java Servlets, I connected the frontend to the backend, enabling dynamic content rendering and smooth data interactions. The system processed patient inputs, stored them in the MySQL database, and handled real-time requests for appointments and records.

For deployment, I utilized Tomcat server, integrating the entire application with Java and ensuring secure, reliable operation.
